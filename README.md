# Stopwatch

This application is a digital stopwatch GUI application that is based on the PyQt5 framework. It offers two modes of operation: manual and automatic. In the manual mode, users can interact with the stopwatch by pressing the button in the GUI window. On the other hand, the automatic mode allows users to control the stopwatch by sending a toggle message through either the ROS or MQTT protocol.
